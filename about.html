<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Lauren Pickel, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am majoring in English and Information Science, as well as pursuing a certificate in Digital Studies and potentially Education Studies.</p>
    
<p>I currently work as an intern for McGraw Hill Publishing and as a Reference Assistant for the Cooperative Children's Book Center here in Madison. In my future, I hope to become a high school librarian and an author. I hope to one day work in a library that houses some of my own pieces of writing.</p>
    
<p>I am an active member of the Madison Undergraduate Society for English (MUSE), the Digital Media Organization (DMO), and the Pickleball Club. In my free time, I enjoy activities like reading, writing, baking, painting, shopping, and spending time with friends and family! Navigate to the <a href="favorites.html"><em>FAVORITES</em></a> page to learn more about some of my favorite things!</p>
